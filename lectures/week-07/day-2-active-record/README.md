## Vocab

**Relational Database**

A relational database is one designed to efficiently query and structure relationships between data. The data is typically structured into tables with columns and rows. *Think SQL when you think Relational Database.*

**Model**

A model is a class that maps to the data relation (table) and potentially bridges tables. You can think of a model as the blueprint (class) for what each row of data is going to contain. Unlike a migration, you perform CRUD on instances of your models.

**Object Relational Mapper (ORM)**

An ORM is a an abstraction layer between our Relational Database and our "Object Oriented" Application. The role of the ORM is to map objects (classes/instances) to entries (tables/rows) in our database. This means we can use a high-level language, like Javascript or Ruby, to create and manipulate our data, instead of writing queries in raw SQL (a "Domain Specific Langauge"). Read more [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279613/what-is-an-orm-and-where-can-i-learn-more-about-it).

**Schema**

You can think of your database schema as a "living document", reflecting the current configuration (e.g. tables, columns, and data constraints) of the tables in your database. You generally DO NOT EDIT your schema file directly -- instead you create a new "migration" to handle the changes for you.

**Migration** a.k.a ‘schema evolution’ or ‘mutation’

Migrations provide us with a mechanism for changing/evolving our database schema over time, as well as a controlled way to "undo" or "roll back" those changes. Each migration represents an historical/incrimental change to our database schema (you can think of it like a git commit). Examples of migrations are creating, deleting and altering tables (and their existing columns). Before you can start manipulating your models, you *MUST* create and run a migration. QUESTION: Why didn't we use migrations in Mongo?

##Would you rather...

| ActiveRecord | SQL |
| :-------------------- | :------- |
| User.all | `SELECT * from users` |
| User.find(123) | `SELECT * from users WHERE users.id = 123 LIMIT 1` |
| user.posts | `SELECT * from posts WHERE posts.user_id = 123` |
| student.courses | `SELECT * FROM courses INNER JOIN enrollments ON courses.id = enrollments.course_id 	WHERE enrollments.student_id = 456	` |

---

## AciveRecord CRUD (in the Console)

#### Create
* `user = User.create(first_name: "Abraham", last_name: "Lincoln")`
* `user = User.create(first_name: "Abraham", last_name: "Maslow")`

NB: See all your users with `User.all`


#### Update

* Find - `user = User.find(1) #the number '1' passed into the find method corresponds to the id of the user it will find`
* Set - `user.first_name = "Taco"`
* Save - `user.save`

**or**

* Find — `user = User.find(1)` 
* Update — `user.update_attributes(first_name: "Taco")`

#### Delete

* Find - `user = User.find(1)`
* Destroy - `user.destroy`

#### More Finding

* `User.all` -> returns an array of allusers
* `User.find_by_last_name('Lincoln')` -> returns the first user that meets the criteria
* `User.where(first_name: 'Abraham')` -> returns an array of users that meet the criteria
* `User.first` -> finds first user
* `User.last` -> finds last user

# Getting Started: 1 Model + Migrations

Please type all this by hand so you're not blindly copying & pasting and you remember it better.

Generate a new Rails project.

`rails new models_example`

Enter your app's direct.

`cd models_example/`

Create our database.

`rake db:create`

### Generate a Models & a Migrations

Create a new model called User with first_name and last_name
properties that are strings. Look at the output and try to decifer what files it just made for you.

`rails generate model User first_name:string last_name:string`

Migrate our database to create the **users** table.

`rake db:migrate`

### Familiarize yourself with the Rails Console

To enter, go to terminal and in the root of your rails app type

`rails console` or `rails c`

(This is IRB with your rails app loaded in.)

Inside of your Rails console, create a new User object.

`irb(main):001:0> albert = User.new`

Set the name of the user.

```
irb(main):002:0> albert.first_name = "Albert"
irb(main):002:0> albert.last_name = "Einstein"
```

Save your user to the database.

`irb(main):003:0> albert.save`

Retrieve all of the users in the database and store then im a users variable.

`irb(main):004:0> users = User.all`

Exit the console.

`exit`

### Modify the existing DB with another Migration

Let's also store a user's age along with their names. Generate a new
migration file named AddAgeToUsers.

`rails generate migration add_age_to_users age:integer`

This will automatically create the right migration.

Run the migration so that the column is added to the table.

`rake db:migrate`

We can check that the migration ran successfully.

`rake db:migrate:status`

NB: We can also undo the migration if we didn't like it.

`rake db:rollback`

# Associations: Relationships between Models

| Relationship type | Abbreviation            | Description                                                       | Example                                                                                        |
| :---------------  | :---------------------- | ------------                                                      | ------------                                                                                   |
| One-to-One        | 1:1                     | Parent model is associated with one child                         | One driver has one driver's license.                                                           |
| One-to-Many       | 1:N                     | Parent model is associated with many children from another model  | One owner `has_many` pets.                                                                     |
| Many-to-Many      | N:N                     | Two models. Both can be associated with many of the other.        | Libraries and books. One library can have many books, while one book can be in many libraries. |


### Active Learning:

Before we move into the actual syntax, let's work together for 10 minutes to come up with some examples of both one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

## One to many (1:N) Relationship

__Example__:
One owner `has_many` pets and...
A pet `belongs_to` one owner (this model will have a foreign key [FK] `owner_id`)

**Always remember!** : Whenever there is a `belongs_to` in the model, there should be a _FK in the matching migration_!

---

### So to set this up, we'll need two models:

```console
rails generate model Pet name:string
rails generate model Owner name:string
```

**Then, we'll need to add the following to our models:**

```ruby
class Owner < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :pets
end

class Pet < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :owner
end
```

Note that in this case, `belongs_to` uses the singular form of the class name (`:owner`), while `has_many` uses the pluralized form (`:pets`). 

But if you think about it, this is exactly how you'd want to say this in plain English. For example, if we were just discussing the relationship between pets and owners, we'd say:

  - "One owner has many pets"
  - "A pet belongs to an owner"

Now, as mentioned, we have to add a foreign key in our migration, so in our pets migration file we should add:

`t.integer :owner_id`

But wait, we could also do something more _rail-sy_ and say  

`t.references :owner`

This makes the association a bit more semantic and readable and has a few bonuses:

  1. It defines the name of the foreign key column (in this case, `owner_id`) for us.
  2. It adds a **foreign key constraint** which ensures **referential data integrity**  in our Postgresql database.

**But wait, there's more...**

We can actually get even more semantic and _rail-sy_ and say:

`t.belongs_to :owner`

This will do the same thing as `t.references`, but it has the added benefit of being super semantic for anyone reading your migrations later on.

---

### Wading in Deeper: Using our Associations

Before we can use our associations, we have to set up our database tables. Let's all run:

```console
rake db:migrate
```

Now, let's jump into our rails console by typing `rails c` at a command prompt, and check out how these new associations can help us define relationships between models:

```ruby
Pet.count
Owner.count
fido = Pet.create(name: "Fido")
lassie = Pet.create(name: "Lassie")
nathan = Owner.create(name: "nathan")
nathan.pets
fido.owner
nathan.pets << fido # Makes "fido" one of my pets
nathan.pets << lassie # Makes "lassie" another one of my pets
nathan.pets.size
nathan.pets.map(&:name)
nathan.pets.each {|x| puts "My pet is named #{x.name}!"}
fido.owner

# What's going to be returned when we do this?
fido.owner.name
```

Remember: We just saw that in Rails, we can associate two model **instances** together using the `<<` operator.

---

#### Wait!!!! What if I forget to add a foreign key before I first run `rake db:migrate`?

If you were to make the mistake of running `rake db:migrate` before adding a foreign key to the table's migration, it's ok. There's no need to panic. You can always fix this by creating a new migration...

```console
rails generate migration NameOfMigrationHere
```

...and then modifying it to include the following:

```ruby
change_table :pets do |t|
  # You ONLY need to add ONE OF THESE THREE to your new migration
  t.integer :owner_id
  # OR...
  t.references :owner
  # OR...
  t.belongs_to :owner
end
```

---

### Class Exercise 1

Let's jump over to [in-class exercise #1](associations_1toN_exercise.md) where you'll all work in groups on a solution.

---

## Many to Many (N:N) with 'through'

Let's think about the example of students and courses. A student can take many courses and a course will have many students. If you think back to our SQL discussions, you'll recall that we used a _join_ table to create this kind of association.

---

### A Typical 'Join' Table

Remember that a _join_ table has two different FKs, one for each model it is associating. In the example below, 3 students have been associated with 4 different courses.

| student_id | course_id |  
| ---------- | --------- |  
| 1          | 1         |  
| 1          | 2         |  
| 1          | 3         |  
| 2          | 1         |  
| 2          | 4         |  
| 3          | 2         |  
| 3          | 3         |  

Let's make sure we understand how this _join table_ works before moving on.

---

### So how do we create N:N associations in rails?

We use the `has_many :relatedModel, :through => :joinTableName` method. 

We'll start by creating 3 models

```console
rails generate model Student name:string
rails generate model Course name:string
rails generate model Enrollment enrollment_date:date 
```

Note that "Enrollment" is our __join__ table.

---

After generating our models, we need to open them in sublime and edit them so they include the proper associations.

Your models should look as follows once you've finished making the necessary changes:

```ruby
# models/course.rb
class Course < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :enrollments
    has_many :students, :through => :enrollments
end
```

```ruby
# models/student.rb
class Student < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :enrollments
    has_many :courses, :through => :enrollments
end
```

```ruby
# models/enrollment.rb
class Enrollment < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :course
    belongs_to :student
end
```

---

We'll also want to modify the migration for the `enrollment` model before we run db:migrate. Make your enrollment model look like this:

```ruby
class CreateEnrollments < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :enrollments do |t|
      t.date :enrollment_date
      t.timestamps null: false

      # The foreign keys for the associations are defined below
      t.references :student
      t.references :course

      # or we can do this instead
      t.belongs_to :student
      t.belongs_to :course
    end
  end
end
```

Make sure your save the file before running `rake db:migrate`. 

(Also, just a reminder, if you're using postgresql, be sure to run `rake db:create` first!)

---

### Let's test out our models!

Open the rails console by running `rails c` in terminal.

At the command prompt, let's create some students:

```ruby
nathan = Student.create(name: "Nathan")
ilias = Student.create(name: "Ilias")
del = Student.create(name: "Delmer")
```

Now we can create some courses too:
```ruby
algebra = Course.create(name: "Algebra")
science = Course.create(name: "Science")
english = Course.create(name: "English")
french = Course.create(name: "French")
```

---

#### Associate our model instances

Now, because we've used `:through`, we can create our associations in the same way we do for a 1:N association. If you're the curious type, you can try just using `has_many` without `through` (outside of class time please!!) and then using the console to experiment and figure out how you'd associate, and then access various instances together. 

```ruby
nathan.courses << algebra
nathan.courses << french

ilias.courses << science
ilias.courses << english
ilias.courses << french

# Here's a little trick: Use an array to associate multiple courses with a student in just one line of code.
del.courses << [english, algebra]
```

---

#### Let's see if it worked

Once you've done all of this, try the following and see if your output matches the below in _irb_.

```ruby
nathan.courses.map(&:name)
# Outputs: => ["Algebra", "French"]

ilias.courses.map(&:name)
# Outputs: => ["Science", "English", "French"]

del.courses.map(&:name)
# Outputs: => ["Algebra", "English"]
```

Side note: Anyone know why we're passing `&:name` to `.map` here? (Hint, it has something to do with Blocks and Procs)

---

### Many-to-Many Exercise 

To do this exercise, let's [head over to our many-to-many exercise file](associations_NtoN_exercise.md) and work together in groups of two.


# Migration Workflow

Getting your models and tables synced up is a bit tricky. Pay close attention to the following workflow, especially the rake tasks.

```
# create a new rails app
rails new my_app -T -d postgresql
cd my_app

# setup the empty database
rake db:create

# <<< BEGIN LOOP >>>

# Auto-generate a new model AND a new migration, e.g.:
rails generate model Pet name:string
rails generate model Owner name:string

# --- OR ---

# If we only need to change fields in an *existing* model,
# we can just generate a new migration:
rails generate migration AddSomeNewFieldToOwner some_new_field:Integer

## Either way, we need to manually edit our models and migrations:
# update the associations in our model --> this affects our model interface
# update the foreign keys in our migrations --> this affects our database tables

# and then we need to generate the schema for our database tables
rake db:migrate

# <<< END LOOP >>>

# Finally, we need some data to play with!
# For now we will seed it manually, from the rails console...
rails c
> Pet.create(name: "Wowzer")
> Pet.create(name: "Rufus")

# --- OR ---

# but later we will run a seed task:
rake db:seed
```

## **H**opefully **H**elpful **H**ints

When you are **creating associations** in Rails' ActiveRecord (or most any ORM, for that matter):

  - You'll define the relationships in your models (the blueprint for your objects)
    + Don't forget to define all sides of the relationship (more on this in a moment)
  - Remember to put the foreign key for a relationship in your migrations
    + If you're not sure which side of the relationship has the foreign key, just use this simple rule: The model with `belongs_to` must include a foreign key.

---

## Validate your Models

We set our [validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) in our app/models/user.rb model.

Let's make sure each user definitely has a first name and a last name before they're saved.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :first_name, presence: true
  validates :last_name, presence: true
end
```

* Type `reload!` into the console to update your model validations.
* Try saving a user with no first or last name and see what error is thrown.

- after_
